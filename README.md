# ðŸ§ª Antibody Binding Kinetics â€” SBE2250 Course Project (Spring 2025)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project is to model and simulate the kinetics of antibody-antigen binding in a flow chamber using a combination of traditional numerical schemes and modern machine learning techniques. This project reproduces and extends the results from Chapter 2 of Schiesser â€“ PDE â€“ MATLAB â€“ 2013, which models the spatial-temporal concentration of free antibodies undergoing diffusion in a fluid and binding to a sensor surface.

Methods Used:
ðŸ§® Numerical Methods

Finite Difference Method (FDM)
A classic discretization technique that approximates derivatives by differences over a grid. It was used to convert the PDE into a system of algebraic equations across time and space.

Crank-Nicolson Method
A time-stepping scheme that is implicit and unconditionally stable. It combines the forward and backward Euler methods, providing second-order accuracy in both time and space for solving the diffusion PDE.

Runge-Kutta Method
A family of iterative methods for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In this project, we used the classical 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) to solve the ODE for surface-bound complex concentration cb(t).

ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Method

Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)
A neural network approach that incorporates the physical laws (PDEs and ODEs) directly into the loss function of the model. By enforcing the governing equations, boundary conditions, and initial conditions during training, PINNs can learn continuous solutions without traditional discretization. This method enables flexible modeling with fewer grid limitations and potential for better generalization in inverse and forward problems.

## ðŸ§  Problem Formulation
We solve a coupled PDE-ODE system modeling the binding kinetics of free analyte (e.g., antibodies) diffusing in a fluid and binding to receptors on a sensor surface.

Governing PDE (Diffusion of Free Analyte c(z,t))
âˆ‚c/âˆ‚t = D âˆ‚Â²c/âˆ‚zÂ²

This describes the one-dimensional diffusion of the free analyte in a domain of length L.

Initial and Boundary Conditions
Initial Condition:
c(z, 0) = 1
(Initial concentration is uniform throughout the domain)

Dirichlet Boundary Condition at z = 1 (top boundary):
c(1, t) = 1
(Maintains the analyte concentration at the top boundary at a constant bulk value)

Reactive Boundary Condition at z = 0 (sensor surface):
D âˆ‚c/âˆ‚z (0, t) = kf * c(0, t) * (csat - cb(t)) - kr * cb(t)
(Models the binding reaction flux at the surface)

Here:

c(z,t) is the free analyte concentration in the fluid

cb(t) is the surface-bound complex concentration

csat is the saturation value of cb

kf and kr are the forward and reverse rate constants

D is the diffusion coefficient

Coupled ODE (Surface Reaction Kinetics)
dc_b/dt = kf * c(0, t) * (csat - cb(t)) - kr * cb(t)

This ODE governs the time evolution of the surface-bound complex cb(t), driven by the analyte concentration at the surface (z = 0)
