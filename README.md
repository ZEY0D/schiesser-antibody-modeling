# ðŸ§ª Antibody Binding Kinetics â€” SBE2250 Course Project (Spring 2025)
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to model and simulate the **kinetics of antibody-antigen binding** in a flow chamber using:
- ðŸ§® **Numerical methods** (Finite Difference - Crank Nicolson - Runge-Kutta)
- ðŸ¤– **Machine Learning methods** (Physics-Informed Neural Networks - PINNs)

We reproduce and extend the results from **Chapter 2 of _Schiesser â€“ PDE â€“ MATLAB â€“ 2013_**, which models the spatial-temporal concentration of antibodies undergoing **diffusion** and **surface reaction binding**.

## ðŸ§  Problem Formulation
We solve a coupled PDE-ODE system modeling the binding kinetics of free analyte (e.g., antibodies) diffusing in a fluid and binding to receptors on a sensor surface.

Governing PDE (Diffusion of Free Analyte c(z,t))
âˆ‚c/âˆ‚t = D âˆ‚Â²c/âˆ‚zÂ²

This describes the one-dimensional diffusion of the free analyte in a domain of length L.

Initial and Boundary Conditions
Initial Condition:
c(z, 0) = 1
(Initial concentration is uniform throughout the domain)

Dirichlet Boundary Condition at z = 1 (top boundary):
c(1, t) = 1
(Maintains the analyte concentration at the top boundary at a constant bulk value)

Reactive Boundary Condition at z = 0 (sensor surface):
D âˆ‚c/âˆ‚z (0, t) = kf * c(0, t) * (csat - cb(t)) - kr * cb(t)
(Models the binding reaction flux at the surface)

Here:

c(z,t) is the free analyte concentration in the fluid

cb(t) is the surface-bound complex concentration

csat is the saturation value of cb

kf and kr are the forward and reverse rate constants

D is the diffusion coefficient

Coupled ODE (Surface Reaction Kinetics)
dc_b/dt = kf * c(0, t) * (csat - cb(t)) - kr * cb(t)

This ODE governs the time evolution of the surface-bound complex cb(t), driven by the analyte concentration at the surface (z = 0)
